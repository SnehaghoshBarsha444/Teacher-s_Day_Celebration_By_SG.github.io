                Since 2016 while studying in class V, your wisdom’s led,<br>
               Through maps and peaks, where dreams are spread,<br>
               You’ve shown us lands both near and far,<br>
               And helped us see how worlds are scarred.<br>
               <br>
               With every lesson, every chart,<br>
               You’ve shaped our minds and touched our hearts,<br>
               A guide through realms both wide and vast,<br>
               Your lessons stay with us, steadfast.<br>
