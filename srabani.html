            <b>On Teacher’s Day, we sing your praise,<br>
            For guiding us through tech’s vast maze.<br>
            In bytes and code, your wisdom gleams,<br>
            You shape our futures, fuel our dreams.<br>
            <br>
            With every lesson, crisp and clear,<br>
            You make complex things disappear.<br>
            Through algorithms, loops, and lines,<br>
            You help us see the grand designs.<br>
            <br>
            In every keystroke, every click,<br>
            You teach us tricks both neat and slick.<br>
            Your patience shines, your knowledge flows,<br>
            In digital realms, your brilliance shows.<br>
            <br>
            So here’s to you, with gratitude,<br>
            For every insight you’ve imbued.<br>
            On this day, we celebrate your way,<br>
            And thank you for all you convey.<br>
