              On Teacher’s Day, we lift our voice,<br>
              For you, whose math we all rejoice.<br>
              In numbers’ dance and formulas’ play,<br>
              You guide us through each complex way.<br>
              With every proof and problem set,<br>
              You spark a light we won’t forget.<br>
             Your wisdom makes the abstract clear,<br>
              Turning doubts to answers near.<br>
             In algebra’s grace, <br>
             You’ve shown us how to find our place.<br>
              Each lesson’s depth and clarity,<br>
               Reflects your skill and generosity.<br>
                <br>
           To you, our guide, so wise and true,<br>
           We celebrate the work you do.<br>
            For shaping minds and hearts with care,<br> Your impact is beyond compare.<br>
