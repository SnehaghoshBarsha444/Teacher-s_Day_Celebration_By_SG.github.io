                To you, my friend, whose heart is pure and true,<br>
                In every moment, I find strength in you.<br>
                Your kindness wraps me in a warm embrace,<br>
                And lifts me up with gentle, steady grace.<br>

                In laughter shared and in the quiet times,<br>
                Your wisdom shines through words and subtle rhymes.<br>
                Respect and trust in every gesture gleam,<br>
                A friendship built upon a timeless dream.<br>
                <br><br><br>
                Through highs and lows, your presence is a guide,<br>
                A treasured soul who stands right by my side.<br>
                For all you are, and all you always give,<br>
                I honor you, dear Rio, and cherish how we live.<br>
