                You are the light that guides me through,<br>
                The one who helps me learn and grow.<br>
                You teach me things I never knew,<br>
                And help me face the world below.<br>
                <br>
                You inspire me to reach for the stars,<br>
                And chase my dreams with all my might.<br>
                You help me heal my deepest scars,<br>
                And make everything seem bright.<br>
                <br>
                I'm grateful for all that you do,<br>
                And for the person that you are.<br>
                I hope this poem conveys to you,<br>
                How much I respect you, dear teacher.<br>
